          <p>In a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6uGkotqKA"> nutshell:</a><br>
              After graduating from FIU with a BS in advertising, I packed my bags to do the cliché millennial thing... Europe trip! (If there's anything worthy of being a cliché over, it's most certainly Europe.)
              <br><br>
              Once I returned, I decided to move cross country and begin working as a catering manager for the LVCC. It was a fast pace, high volume environment where I worked long days, weekends, and learned how to manage clients and employees. The unconventional work schedule, fast pace environment, and my ambitious nature got me a promotion along with the opportunity to work in marketing. I took it, moved to Philadelphia, and became the national marketing manager for Cigna. This is where my problem solving skills became my greatest asset - math does pay off! I wore many hats as a marketing manager and became a Jane of all trades: project manager, presenter, and teacher.
              <br><br>
              ​I have now moved to Miami, where I'm excited to begin a new chapter in my life, further develop my skills, and work in a collaborative environment.</p>

        <p>Don't be shy. Shoot me an email. If you're really feeling daring, call me! Don't know what to say? Here are some topics we can chat about: art, coffee, that new restaurant in Wynwood, or the weather - if you're into small talk. You can even call just to say, "Hi."</p>
